# rabbitmq-server is only in the trusty-mitaka and xenial-queens cloud-archive
#
# The charm isn't always updated with the latest release (e.g. jammy-zed) so
# errors out if we set it unconditionally.
#
# For jammy onwards we can expect the charmhub channel to setup any required
# source, but to maintain backwards compatability with trusty-mitaka and
# xenial-queens we need to set source on those releases
#
# We do that here in an overlay so that the config value is not set at all on
# jammy and uses the charm default
